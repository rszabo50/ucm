A terminal-based connection manager for SSH and Docker with a powerful, mouse-friendly interface.

> **Note**: UCM is inspired by [nccm](https://github.com/flyingrhinonz/nccm) but built with [urwid](http://urwid.org/) for enhanced mouse support and a modern terminal UI.

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **SSH Connection Management** - Organize and connect to SSH hosts with ease
- 🐳 **Docker Container Access** - Quick console access to running containers
- ⭐ **Connection History & Favorites** - Track usage and mark favorite connections
- 🔍 **Real-time Filtering** - Instantly search through hundreds of connections
- 🖱️ **Mouse Support** - Full mouse and keyboard navigation
- ⚙️ **Configuration Validation** - Automatic config checking with helpful error messages
- 📝 **Flexible Config** - Simple YAML configuration with sensible defaults
- 🎨 **Clean TUI** - Beautiful terminal interface powered by urwid

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/rszabo50/ucm.git
cd ucm
pip install -e .

# Run UCM
ucm
```

### First Run

On first launch, UCM will create a default configuration at `~/.ucm/ssh_connections.yml`:

```bash
ucm
```

Edit the configuration file to add your SSH connections:

```bash
# Edit with your favorite editor
vi ~/.ucm/ssh_connections.yml
```

### Quick Example

```yaml
# ~/.ucm/ssh_connections.yml
- name: webserver
  address: web.example.com

- name: database
  address: db.example.com
  user: admin
  port: 2222
  identity: ~/.ssh/db-key.pem
```

Launch UCM and start connecting!

- **[Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Contributing and development setup
- **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to UCM

## 🎯 Use Cases

UCM is perfect if you:

- ✅ Manage dozens (or hundreds!) of SSH hosts
- ✅ Have different SSH requirements per host (identities, ports, users)
- ✅ Need quick console access to Docker containers
- ✅ Want to filter and view all connections at once
- ✅ Prefer efficient command-line workflows
- ✅ Work in environments without a GUI

## ⚙️ Configuration

### SSH Connections

Configuration is stored in `~/.ucm/ssh_connections.yml` by default.

**Required fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier
- `address`: IP or hostname

**Optional fields:**
- `user`: SSH username (default: current user)
- `port`: TCP port (default: 22, range: 1-65535)
- `identity`: Path to SSH key file
- `options`: Additional SSH options
- `category`: Grouping label

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Minimal connection
- name: webserver
  address: web.example.com

# Full configuration
- name: production-db
  address: db.example.com
  user: admin
  port: 2222
  identity: ~/.ssh/prod-key.pem
  options: -X
  category: production

# Using SSH config defaults
- name: jumphost
  address: jump.example.com
  # UCM respects ~/.ssh/config for additional settings
```

See [`examples/ssh_connections.yml`](examples/ssh_connections.yml) for more examples.

### Connection History and Favorites

UCM automatically tracks your SSH connection usage and allows you to mark favorites.

**Features:**
- ⭐ **Favorites** - Press `f` to toggle favorite status (marked with ★)
- 📊 **Usage Tracking** - Automatically records connection timestamps and use counts
- 💾 **Persistence** - History and favorites saved to `~/.ucm/history.yml` and `~/.ucm/favorites.yml`
- 📈 **Statistics** - Track most-used connections and usage patterns

**Benefits:**
- Quickly identify frequently-used servers
- Mark critical servers as favorites for easy identification
- Track connection patterns across your infrastructure

### Configuration Validation

UCM automatically validates your configuration and provides helpful error messages:

```
❌ Configuration Error:
SSH connection configuration has 2 error(s):
  - Connection #1 ('server1'): Missing required field(s): address
  - Connection #2: 'port' must be between 1 and 65535, got 99999
```

### Custom Configuration Directory

```bash
# Use custom config location
ucm --config-dir ~/my-configs

# Different log level
ucm --log-level DEBUG

# Custom log file
ucm --log-file /var/log/ucm.log
```
